### Knowledge about statistical machine learning

My research interests lie in field of computer vision and natural language processing. I have knowledges of machine learning methods like support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), image/video processing, and natural language processing. Now I'm developing methods to improve the performance of deep neural network (DNN) model which runnning on poor-resource environment like mobile phone. Also I studied about sentiment analysis with using RNN-based DNN model before.

### Knowledge about Front-end web development

I have experiences with developing webapps as team, so I have knowledge of typical developing workflow, GitHub issue, CI, and deployment.
